# Libraries
- Libraries are collections of code that other people have written. 
- Video games often use massive libraries (for example: game engines) to create the epic water reflections, 3-D graphics, etc.
- We are going to start a bit smaller by just generating random numbers. (After all, random numbers are the basis of most games).

# Random library
- We can use a library by writing import and then the library name.
