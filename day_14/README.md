# Rock, paper, Scissors

- Today's challenge involved building a rock, paper, scissors game. <br/>

- I started with the code below to ensure that whenever I use input, each player cannot see what the other player typed in ðŸ˜‰: <br/>

`from getpass import getpass as input`

- For this version, I have two players. Player 1 and Player 2.

- I created if statements to decide who has won, lost or if the game is a tie.
