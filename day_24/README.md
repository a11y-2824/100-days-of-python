# Subroutines

- In a subroutine, the `()` are for the argument (FYI argument is another word for parameter). 
- These are the pieces of information we pass to the code. 
- These can be variable names that are made up for the first time within the argument ()
- We can have as many arguments as we want, separated by commas.
