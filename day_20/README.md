# Range

- Give `range` one number, and it will count up to that number. 
- However, you can actually give the range function a few options...
	- **starting value:** what number do you want to start with?
	- **ending value:** the number after the number you want to end with (example: if you type 10 as the ending value, the computer will count until 9)
	- **increment:** How much should it increase by every time it loops? (example: Do you want to count by 1s, 5s, 10s?)
