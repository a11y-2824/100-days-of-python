# For Loop

- A `while` loop is perfect to use when we don't know how many times we want the loop to repeat.

- If we have an idea of how many times we want the loop to repeat, we can use a `for` loop to loop code in exactly the same way the while loop did

# Range
- The `range` function creates a list of numbers in the range you create. 
- If you only give it one number, it will start at 0 and move to a state where the final number is one less than the number in the brackets
