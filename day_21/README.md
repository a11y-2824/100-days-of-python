# Project Day

- Test your family and friends on their multiplication knowledge 
- Prompt the user by asking for a multiplication table for the number of their choice.
- Generate the multiplication table for 1 to 10 times that number and ask each math fact as a question (psst...that's a hint).
- If the user gets the math correct, award them a point. If they get it wrong, do not give them any points.
- At the end of the 10 rounds, show the user their score out of 10 for how many math facts they got correct.
